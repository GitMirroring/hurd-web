[[!meta title="Debian GNU/Hurd"]]

Debian GNU/Hurd is an effort to port the Debian distribution to the Hurd. Around 75% of Debian packages can already be run under Debian GNU/Hurd, which makes it very usable. See the [[Status]] of the Debian port for more information.

<!-- I don't know what it means that /etc/mtab -> /proc/mounts, but this is what I could interpret.
     It was simply a line (h1, for some reason, on this page and it looked out of place. Correct or even delete this if it makes no sense -->

One notable difference in this port, is that `/etc/mtab` -> `/proc/mounts`

# Installing
The Debian installer runs natively on the Hurd and it is possible to install a Debian GNU/Hurd system booting it from an IDE or SATA CD-ROM drive or from a USB stick. See 
[installation instructions](http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-install) for details and post-installation configuration.

# CrossInstall
It is possible to install a Debian GNU/Hurd system on a spare partition from an existing Debian GNU/Linux installation. We call this [[CrossInstall]].
