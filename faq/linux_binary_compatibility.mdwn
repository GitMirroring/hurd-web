[[!meta title="Could there be a compatibility with Linux binaries?"]]

When you have free software, you can just recompile it and be done :)

Adding such a compatibility layer would be quite a lot of work since we'd have
to check all the ABI details to make them match exactly.

In the end, the required effort is really not clearly worth the benefit, when
you can just recompile the software.
