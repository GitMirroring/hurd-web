Perhaps your `/dev/` got hurt. You can mount by hand (e.g. on `/target`)
your root filesystem from a Hurd installation CD and run

    chroot /target dpkg-reconfigure hurd

or

    chroot /target /usr/lib/hurd/setup-translators -k -p

or even completely by hand:

    settrans -cfg /target/dev/console /hurd/term /dev/console device console
    settrans -cfg /target/dev/null /hurd/null
    settrans -cfg /target/servers/socket/1 /hurd/pflocal
    settrans -cfg /target/dev/urandom /hurd/random --seed-file /var/lib/random-seed --fast

to restore it or at least the basic parts.

You can also try to fix some entries from a Linux system (mounting it as ext4) with:

    touch /target/dev/console
    touch /target/dev/null
    touch /target/servers/socket/1
    touch /target/dev/urandom
    setfattr -n gnu.translator -v "/hurd/term\0/dev/console\0device\0console\0" /target/dev/console
    setfattr -n gnu.translator -v "/hurd/null\0" /target/dev/null
    setfattr -n gnu.translator -v "/hurd/pflocal\0" /target/servers/socket/1
    setfattr -n gnu.translator -v "/hurd/random\0--seed-file\0/var/lib/random-seed\0--fast\0" /target/dev/urandom
