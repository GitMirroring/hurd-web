[[!meta title="830 MiB RAM Limit"]]

The 830MB RAM limit has been removed since long. The default version of the
Debian `gnumach` package will limit themselves to 3 GiB of memory. If you
want more, you can try the PAE version, but this requires using rumpdisk for
accessing disks.

Note that by architecture design, 32bit systems can only provide at most 4GiB
addressing space for processes. With a 32bit kernel, part of is is used by the
kernel. It is also possible you use a 32-on-64 kernel, to provide the full 4GB
adress space to userland. To give more to userland, use a fully-64b Hurd.
