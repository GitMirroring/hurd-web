[[!meta title="Fails to boot with /dev/console: Read-only file system"]]

Somehow your `/dev/console` got hurt. You can mount by hand (e.g. on `/target`)
your root filesystem from a Hurd installation CD and run

    settrans /target/dev/console /hurd/term /dev/console device console

to restore it.

You can also set it from a Linux system with:

    setfattr -n gnu.translator -v "/hurd/term\0/dev/console\0device\0console\0" /target/dev/console
