**What is left for initial support (32-on-64) is**

  * Fixing bugs :)

**For pure 64bit support, we need to**

  * Fix bugs :)
  * bootstrap a distrib

**Installing a 64bit chroot**

Make sure to have `debootstrap >= 1.0.128+nmu2+hurd.1`

    sudo debootstrap --foreign --verbose --arch hurd-amd64 --include=debian-keyring --keyring=/usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg sid chroot-hurd-amd64 https://people.debian.org/~sthibault/tmp/hurd-amd64
    sudo mkdir chroot-hurd-amd64/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d
    sudo ln -s /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg chroot-hurd-amd64/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/

Or use the pre-built image from https://people.debian.org/~sthibault/hurd-i386/initrd-amd64.img.gz

Then boot it, it will drop you into a shell. You need to make / writable:

    fsysopts / --writable

and then run the second stage of the deboostrap (and clear debs):

    /debootstrap/debootstrap --second-stage
    apt clean

set a root password:

    password

and reboot:

    reboot-hurd

**Installing a 64bit system**

In principle crosshurd should be working, one however needs to add this source:

    deb http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/tmp/hurd-amd64 unstable

into /etc/crosshurd/sources.list/gnu
